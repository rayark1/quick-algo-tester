# Quick Algo Tester - Demo

Welcome to the demo for `quick-algo-tester`! This guide will help you understand how to use the tester tool through simple examples.

## Getting Started

1. **Sample Input Files**: Inside the `testcases` directory, there are sample input files that you can use to test. Files that serve as input start with the prefix `input`, such as `input1.txt`, which might contain test input for a specific problem.

2. **Expected Output Files**: Corresponding to each input file inside the `testcases/` directory, there's an expected output file that starts with the prefix `output`. For example, `output1.txt` would contain the expected output for the given `input1.txt`.

3. **Running the Tester**: To run the tester tool with the sample input, navigate to the project's root directory and execute:

   ```bash
   python [quick-algo-tester.py] demo/solution1 solution1
   ```

## Understanding the Results

After running the tester, it will compare the output of your solution to the expected output. The results will clearly indicate whether the test passed or failed.
